 <h2>Brianna Beharrie</h2>
 <p>I am a second year Computer Science major at the University of the West Indies,Mona.Some of my hobbies include reading books,singing,
    dancing, playing games and (maybe an odd one)looking at houses/apartments online which stems from my love for design and being creative.
    Creating software and websites for people in order to make their businesses more efficient and their lives more fulfilling is a goal of mine
    so I am intrigued by Web Design as it involves designing websites using code to cater to a client's needs in a creative and effective way.
    The internet is filled with resources that aid people in everyday life and I believe it should continue to make certain activities more convenient for us
    with the enormous amounts of new technologies, information and businesses that are invented continuously. </p>
